WhatsApp View Once Bypass is a Chrome extension that enhances WhatsApp Web functionality by allowing users to view and save photos indefinitely, bypassing the app's view once feature.

## Features

- **Override View Once**: View and save photos marked for view once multiple times.
- **Download Media**: Download media files even if they are set to disappear after a single view.
- **IndexedDB Integration**: Utilizes IndexedDB to manage message statuses and preferences.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tharinduxd/whatsapp-view-once-bypass-chrome-extension.git
   ```

2. **Load the extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable Developer mode (toggle switch usually located in the top right corner).
   - Click on "Load unpacked" and select the cloned `whatsapp-view-once-bypass-chrome-extension` directory.

## Usage

Open WhatsApp Web in your Google Chrome browser. Photos marked for view once will now be viewable multiple times and can be downloaded.
